## Hi there 👋

🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- I can do HTML, CSS, SASS, JS, Astro, and TS now.
- I enjoy debugging and have a keep on eye for identifying edge cases and inconsistencies in code.
⚡ Fun fact: 🏕️ Camping, 🧗 Bourldering, 🎲 Board games, 🗺️ Just watching google map, 🚶 Walk some new place ...
